  annote = "{A Renderman compliant renderer developed by Ian Stephenson, I initially chose to use it because it had support for geometry shaders that provided me with a simple way of creating an ice cube shape through the use of superquadrics. Unfortunately, the superquad shader did not work with shadows, the feature set is fairly dated compared to current PRMan releases and opacity support was too noisy (which presented a problem for a project that makes heavy use of translucency), forcing me to move on to using Pixar's Renderman instead.}"
